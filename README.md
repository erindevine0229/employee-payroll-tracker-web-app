# Employee Payroll Tracker Application


## Description
A company needed a webpage application which can track the salary data for their employees. The site will collect emplyee first name, last name and salary via prompts to the user. The site can then manipulate the collected data to calculate average salaries, report how many salaries total are reported and to select, at random, an employee from the list to be a random drawing winner. That information is available in the DevTools console. JavaScript code is used to perform these functions.
